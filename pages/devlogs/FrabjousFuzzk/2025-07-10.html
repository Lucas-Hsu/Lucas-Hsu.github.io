        <h2><a id="Background" href="#Background">Background</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I've made a few games before, most of which were simple and fun. 
          For example, SprayGame is all about spraying monkeys with water, and there are only two enemy types. 
          Similarly, PUSH was a first person shooter with a melee kick and a ranged autoaim gun attack, and your goal was
          just to push the cyan cube back to the top of the ramp while avoiding enemies since you only have 1 HP.
          However, Parody 1999 was a bit more complex, as I was making a parody of a card game, which had complex character 
          and skill rules. 
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I don't actually understand why those games were fun, and why I ran out of interest
          in playing them after a while. So, I looked online, and stumbled across these two types of categorizations: 
        </p>
        <ul class="proportionalFont" style="margin-top: -0.4em">
          <li>Adam Millard's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVJUGoSSuzE">"6 Types of Difficulty"</a></li>
          and
          <li>Mark Leblanc's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com">Eight Kinds of Fun</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="proportionalFont" style="margin-top: -0.4em"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> While I'm not yet sure if they are fully correct, the categories provide a good reference
          when thinking about how to design a fun game. Ideally we would want to contain multiple types of fun and difficulty to make
          sure more players can enjoy the game, and that they won't get tired of the same old thing repeating too often.

        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Most difficulty in games can be put into one of these categories, 
          but they could also fit in multiple. I'm choosing Precision, Computation, and Navigation for the game I will be making. 
          I feel like some visual organization or mathematical computation goes along well with timed, precise actions that the player will have to perform. 
          At the same time, navigation can provide as the alternative gameplay loop in between those challenges.
        </p> 
        <img class="medium-y" src="/images/no-copyright/8KindsOfFun.png"/>
        <p class="proportionalFont">
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Mark Leblanc's 8 Kinds of Fun is a more broad categorization, summarizing the main reasons why people play 
          video games. This will greatly affect the themes and intended audience for the game. Also, certain categories like Sensation or Narrative 
          are difficult for me to make as I have less skills in visual arts and writing stories. Fellowship is difficult too, as I am unfamiliar with multiplayer code. 
          I'm still going to focus on Challenge because those are the types of games I would like to play. Of course, I get bored of difficult games
          very quickly if I don't win, so I will also combine it with Submission by adding easy and calm gameplay sections. 
        </p>
        <h2><a id="Ideas" href="#Ideas">Basic Ideas</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> As I discussed above, the game will have a basic gameplay loop like this:
        </p>
        <img class="medium-y" src="/images/GameplayLoop-1.png"/>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> At this point, I think most of the games I've played were like this, which means it's a good idea. It's just that I 
          haven't really made a game like this before. Undergrowth was exactly like this, but the scope of that game was too large, and it went unfinished. 
          So another thing to consider is how complex the game should be. Since I'm making it by myself, within a duration of 7 days 
          (spent on development and polishing) at most, I must make it very simple.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> For the next devlog, I will discuss the game's development engine, art style, themes, gameplay details, and exhaustive feature list, along with the development schedule.
