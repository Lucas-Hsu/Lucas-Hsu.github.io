      <h2><a id="EA" href="#EA">Early Access Release</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Finally! You can now play my game at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lucashsu.itch.io/frabjous-fuzzk-beta">lucashsu.itch.io/frabjous-fuzzk-beta</a>. Please comment 
        feedback or ask questions there so I can improve my game through user feedback! I hope you enjoy Frabjous Fuzzk!
      </p>

      <h2><a id="Add" href="#Add">Things I Added</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I added a custom cursor to make it more clear when you are able to select objects. I also drew some simple art for the bossfight. 
        And finally, I added the fuzzks helping you in hunt mode feature. I'm calling it Hunt Assist.

      </video>  
      <p style="text-align: center;">More Fuzzks means easier hunting</p>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Now, the more Fuzzks you have following you, the more likely that Fuzzks 
        will help attack the Shells for you in hunt mode. This is very helpful as it makes the hunting mini-game more lenient as you get more and more Fuzzks. 
        This helps tie my game systems together, since hunting Shells levels you up which makes dance battles easier, and winning dance battles makes more Fuzzks 
        follow you which makes hunting easier. This also works in the bossfight, but since the boss progressively eats your Fuzzks, it gets harder and harder, introducing a
        a new and reasonable layer of difficulty.

      <h2><a id="Bugs" href="#Bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Throughout the devlogs, I never really focused on the bugs, because they were less interesting than the new features. And really, there is 
        not much point in focusing on them, because usually it'd just be a dumb mistake. But if you're making a game and worrying about the bugs you have, don't! Everyone makes mistakes,
        whether it be silly, ignorant, careless, or naive. There's been countless bugs in my game, and I think, over half the time I spent on coding was spent on debugging. The most annoying 
        issues were often due to some line of code that I wrote a long time ago that was logically incorrect, but it was just one line of code, which made it easy to overlook. Compiler warnings 
        and runtime errors are much easier to fix. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> One thing that helps with reducing logical errors that cause those hard-to-detect bugs is to plan things out first. Just like how I drew the Finite-State Machine 
        for the Toes on paper before I started coding. It allows you to think through the whole thing before starting, so that you don't need to change implementation method midway, which would likely introduce 
        errors due to conflicting ideas. 
        <br><br> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I didn't do this, but I think it would have been really helpful if I wrote comments in my code. Comments that explain *why* I am doing it this way instead of that, 
        so if I ever want to refactor the code, I can make an informed decision, instead of being too afraid to delete code since you are unsure why that code was necessary before.

      <h2><a id="Future" href="#Future">Future</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> For now, I'm going to take a break from development, wait for user feedback to come in, and focus on my summer homework and 
        summer program. I'll continue to update this website when I have time, so check back once in a while!
