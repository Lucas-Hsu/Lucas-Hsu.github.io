        <span class="tabspace"></span> I finally implemented the hunting minigame. It adds another layer to the gameplay 
        and makes the game feel more varied. Other than that, I drew some more art and animations, as well as fixed a few bugs in the code.

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The hunting minigame went through several iterations before I was satisfied with the result. 
        Though the general idea was the same, the exact implementation details change the mood and feel of the minigame drastically. 
        As I stated during the planning phase, I wanted this to be a precise, complex, and high-pressure challenge. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I first implemented it as a sort of button mashing minigame like the hacking mini-game in 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://90s.graphics/about/">Peripeteia</a>, where you press lots of buttons randomly 
        until you hit the correct buttons in the right order to progress through the minigame. Peripeteia's hacking mini-game does well to simulate the 
        excitement and *coolness* of being a skilled hacker. However, the same design cannot work everywhere. In my hunting mini-game, I wanted it 
        to simulate a more reactive behavior, specifically of a predator wrestling with a fierce prey, attempting to prevent it from escaping.
        The button mashing was simple and fun, but it went against my design. In other words, I wanted it to be more methodical.

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The first thing I did was add a penalty for pressing the wrong button. It slowed the pacing of the 
        minigame down because it immediately provided a challenge. Press the keys presented on the keys, and <i>only</i> those keys. I thought 
        of two ways of implementing the penalty. The first was to decrease the timer by a large amount for every wrong button pressed. This is good 
        because I already had a timer, but the timer didn't affect the gameplay too much, and now this makes the timer more meaninful. However, 
        removing time from the timer is unintuitive because players would naturally assume timers tick down second by second. The other idea was to 
        take note of how many wrong key the player pressed, and fail the player when it reaches a certain threshold. This makes errors concrete 
        and makes it easy for me to adjust the margin of error, but the arbitrariness of the threshold would be annoying to the user. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Ultimately, I decided that the former idea was better. To deal with the downside of the timer being unintuitive, 
        I could just represent the counting down timer with a "Escape Meter" progress bar that slowly goes from green to red, and makes large jumps 
        whenever you press a wrong button. I'm still figuring out what's the best way to work with UI, so I haven't made that change yet.

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> One last thing I had to consider when designing the minigame was the coordination between left and right hand. 
        I found that I could complete the minigame faster and easier if I just focused on pressing the button prompts for one hand ("j","k","l") and 
        ignored the left hand. Conceptually it was like the Fuzzk was having a stroke, one half side of its body completely motionless. That went 
        against the idea of having to coordinate your body just like when Fuzkks hunt prey, especially because I wanted 
        each finger to feel like one of the Fuzzks' legs. In order to solve this problem of over-specialization, I made it so that the button 
        prompts only update when you press two keys, one for the left hand ("s", "d", ""f), and one for the right hand. 
      </p>

      <h2><a id="pArty" href="#pArty">Dance pART(y)</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I drew and shaded new animation sprites for the player character. The time spent on shading 
        was mostly wasted because its too small to see. I guess I was right, shouldn't have shaded it. But it was good practice, as 
        it really helps improve my art skills.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Luckily the Fuzzks are the same creature as the player character, so all I had to do was hue-shift 
        the player sprites into each of the other colors of the rainbow to get the Fuzzk sprites. I think you can do that inside Godot, but 
        I generated new images using some simple python code, by treating the RGBA images as HSV, and then modifying the hue values by a specific amount 
        for each Fuzzk. That's because I might go back and modify some of the details in the sprites when I have free time in the future, since 
        in my design, each Fuzzk has a different number of hairs on their head based on their age.

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> If you are above the required lvl (you gain xp to lvl up by hunting), you can interact with 
        specific Fuzzks to enter a dance battle with them. The battle is just a rhythm game. You copy whatever dance move they are dancing, 
        and if you do it wrong, or fail to keep up, your stamina decreases. If you do it correctly, their stamina decreases. You win if they 
        run out of stamina and you loose if you run out of stamina first. After you win, they join you on your team. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The only way to fight the final boss is if you collect all Fuzzks, because the final boss battle will be impossible difficult if 
        you don't. The story reason for that is, since Scary Monster devoured Red Fuzzk, you need to assemble all the other colors of the rainbow 
        in your team, and once you get near the Scary Monster, the rainbow colors will interact with the Red Fuzzk inside the belly of the 
        Scary Monster, and Scary Monser will be greatly weakened, opening it up to your attacks.
