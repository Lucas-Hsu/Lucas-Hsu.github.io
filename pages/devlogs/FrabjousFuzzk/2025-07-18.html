      <h2><a id="Thanatoes" href="#Thanatoes">Thanatoes</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> With the final wisp of lifeforce kicked out of its fragile body, the Toe 
        takes one last look at the cruel world with its non-existent eyes. Then, at first slowly but quickly spreading, its dark purple 
        body disintegrates, just like Thanos at the end of <i>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</i>. All that is left are the two wings, 
        made of marshmellow andâ€“HEY! Don't eat that, he touched it with his foot!
      </p>

      <img class="large-y" src="/images/thanatoes.gif"/>
      <p>Toeny starkly dies</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The animation for the Toes' death is not at all funny or silly. 
        Rather, I think it's calm, peaceful, and maybe even a little elegant. The way the wings slowly drop to the ground 
        like feathers, it really feels soft and comforting. After a very intense battle of kicking and stinging, thousands of flaps 
        of the wings, the Toe finally dies. That hideous creature, finally at peace.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> It's a surprise that this Toe death animation turned out so well. I just wanted my enemy carcasses to despawn like how other games do it, 
        disappearing when you aren't looking. However, it was a bit weird to have random purple feet on the ground, so I designed the 
        toes to be easily destroyed, so when you kick them a lot, their body breaks, and only the wings remain. The fading out me trying 
        out how to use linear interpolation (lerp), which I eventually used on the wings dropping down, as well as the Toes' changing 
        direction. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I think the fact that the death animation of this video game creature is so intriguing shows that 
        the enemy is lifelike enough. Right? Without life, there can be no death. So it's pretty cool to see. A lot of the work was accomplished 
        by the "advanced" AI system I programmed for it, but the art and animations really did the most in bringing the creature alive.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> What I'm trying to say is that I was wrong, at the beginning of my planning for this game, to assume 
        that the art doesn't matter as long as the core gameplay is fun. We don't like playing text-based games, not because we don't like reading,
        but beacuse a game is a sum of all it's parts. I think every single component in a game matters. That's the gameplay, the sound effects, 
        the artwork and visual effects, the soundtrack, the story, the user interface, and maybe even the keyboard controls!
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> However, my time is limited, and I do not have the skills to do everything on my own. I'm nearing the end 
        of my 7-Day development plan, and the game probably won't be in a satisfactory shape by the end of tomorrow. I still have to add the UI, the sound 
        effects, the final bossfight, as well as the saving&loading system. 
      </p>

      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://files.catbox.moe/">Here's a video of what the game looks like right now (?.?MB)</a>

      <h2><a id="Local" href="#Local">Local Spawners</a></h2>
      <img class="large-y" src="/images/world_editor.png"/>
      <p>The Overworld as it appears to me in the Godot Editor </p>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> One important addition to the game is the local spawner. Instead of a global spawner that  
        keeps track of the total amount of each type of enemy in the world, and spawns them right outside view of the player, local 
        spawners are their own isolated ecosystem. This allows for more varied ranges of enemy combinations. That is to say, it's more
        realistic, because the world map contains ice mountains, swamps, deserts, forests, grass plains, and a river, so it's impossible 
        for the entire world to have the exact same random placement of enemies. Now, I can make there be more Toes along the river, and 
        make the grass plain abundant with Shells.
      </p>

      
      <h2><a id="UI" href="#UI">User Interface</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The other change I made is to the User Interface design. Instead of displaying the 
        player's health under them, I removed it completely, and instead made it so that a vignette effect appears and gradually darkens
        as the player's health decreases. It's less accurate, but it's more visually appealing, and gives immediate visual 
        feedback rather than requiring the player to read a number. If you say that healthbars don't require reading, well, they don't 
        provide good accuracy of health value either. In fact, I completely removed health bars from enemies, and even the Fuzzks. 
        <br><br>

       <p>Stubbed by Toes</p>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I'm not sure yet if it's necessary to show the player the progress of the dance battle, or if the damage flashes are enough. 
        I think, a disco ball that shines brighter and brighter as you progress through the dance would be very nice, but would take 
        a lot of time to draw. For now, the damage flashes are enough. Of course, if you fail to do the correct dance move, you take damage, 
        and the vignette effect gets darker. 
        <br><br>

      <img class="medium-y" src="/images/dance_flashes.gif"/>
      <p>Dance Battle</p>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> As I designed, there will still be a progress bar for the hunting countdown. 
        But instead of a number that shows the Shell's remaining stamina, I'll instead modulate the sprite, make it gradually more red as 
        you attack it with you press the correct keys.
      </p>
      
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I'll try to finish as much of the game as I can tomorrow, but if needs be, 
        I still have an extra day to spend on the game this Sunday.
