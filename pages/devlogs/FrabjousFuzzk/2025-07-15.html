      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I drew a lot of art for the map, and added the followers system today. Drawing 
        was unexpectedly fun. I started out being completely lost at how to use Pencil2D, but now I'm finally beginning to draw 
        art that doesn't look dumb or funny! I also added a TV so the player can waste time inside my game.
      </p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The TV was absolutely necessary! Do not question my devotion to my original plan!
        You see, to bring about this carefree mood that the game is going for, we need to invoke memories from your childhood. 
        And what did you do very much when you were young and had lots of free time? Watch TV (and play video games) >:D. 
      </p>

      <h2><a id="Art" href="#Art">We're Full of Art Now, Romeo!</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I'm going to show you some of the art I drew for the game. 
      </p>

      <img class="x-large-y" src="/images/unscary_monster_cave.png"/>
      <p>(Un)Scary Monster Cave</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I started by drawing the Scary Monster cave, but it looked stupid. 
        I tried it at first with a human skull, but that was too familiar. So, I referenced a T-Rex skull when 
        I was drawing the sprite above. However, I was still not happy with how it turned out.
        The lines were weird. I determined that I'm not good at drawing details and sharp edges yet, so 
        I went off and practiced on some other art. I drew one of the golden things from the ball and jacks toy set 
        on my desk:
      </p>

      <img class="small-y" src="/images/ball_and_jack_only_jack_tho_haha_lol.png"/>
      <p>Golden "Jack"</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I mean, if you squint, it looks kind of realistic. But the shape was really awful,
        and I think the reason is because I'm using my MacBook's trackpad instead of drawing on an iPad. That, or I need a ruler tool. 
        Anyway, I had the great idea of just drawing round things instead, and it got me this:
      </p>

      <img class="x-large-y" src="/images/Red_House.png"/>
      <p>Red Fuzzk's House</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I like the smooth, soft shading on the round surfaces. Shading a 
        sphere is just about all I remember from my sketching classes now. The highlights on the window frames 
        still look off, and it's even a little unnerving. A friend of mine says they look like "Cthulu Eyes", whatever that means
        Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Now, some of you might wonder how exactly I drew those sprites, because I told you 
        before that I'm really a beginner at art. Well, it's simple. You just have to use the S P O N G E B O B Method:
      </p>

      <img class="small-y" src="/images/no-copyright/spongebobs_method.gif"/>
      <p>Of course not!</p>

      <ol class="proportionalFont">
        <li>
          <b>Pick your color palette.</b> Since I'm drawing things with only one color, I'm just going to choose about 5 or 6 
          shades of the same color. The shadows should be less saturated than the parts in direct sunlight, but the highlights 
          should also be close to white.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Block out the overall shape.</b> In my case, I choose the midtone color, and draw shapes with the largest pen size first, and then
          when I'm done, move down to a medium sized pen to fill in a little more detail. I then use the eraser to trim the silhouette.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fill in the shadows.</b> I'm going to pick a darker, less saturated color, and block out the shadows. I'll also use a "feathered" 
          pen to smoothen the transition between light and dark here, because it's a sphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Draw the highlights.</b> It's self explanatory. Sometimes, highlights aren't even necessary because there's enough 
          detail already.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Finally, the details.</b> I add the door and the windows. Actually, they follow the same steps as before, just with smaller pen sizes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I quickly drew some of the other houses, taking inspiration from food items of the corresponding colors.
      </p>

      <div style="flex-direction: row;">
        <div style="flex-direction: column;">
          <img class="medium-y" src="/images/Orange_House.png"/>
          <p>Orange's House, Burgers and Hot Dogs. (Double decker)</p>
        </div>
        <div style="flex-direction: column;">
          <img class="medium-y" src="/images/Yellow_House.png"/>
          <p>Yellow's House, Bananas. (This is my favorite. Looks almost surreal!)</p>
        </div>
        <div style="flex-direction: column;">
          <img class="medium-y" src="/images/Green_House.png"/>
          <p>Green's House, Peas. (They taste awful, and this looks awful)</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> I got bored of drawing buildings, so decided to draw one last house before I moved on. Here, for Cyan, the player character,
        I decided to use the same style as Red's house, but with a more aquatic feel. 
      </p>

      <img class="medium-y" src="/images/Cyan_House.png"/>
      <p>Cyan's House (SpOOOoOOoOoky!)</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Notice how the texture of the house feels different from Red's house.
        That was more rough, and this feels, more metallic. It's due to the higher contrast between the tones of color I picked.
        Here, it gives the house a Pearly* look.
      </p>

      <p>* Maybe you haven't seen cyan pearls before, but they do exist! Either way, you get what I mean. They're shiny! </p>

      <h2><a id="Rock" href="#Rock">Rocks are hard</a></h2>
      <img class="small-y" src="/images/Rock.png"/>
      <p> Took a long time, but the final result is pretty solid! </p>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Rocks were genuinely hard to draw because of the sharp edges and weird shape. I started and failed a lot,
        before I decided to trace over the ðŸª¨ emoiji (sadly not the ðŸ—¿ emoji) because it looked like a very good rock to me. After I understood 
        how rocks worked, I was able to draw them on my own. The basic idea is to first think of the rock as a smooth sphere, and carve layers into 
        the rock to add those bumpy parts.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Actually, that reminds me, the rocks in my game don't actually have to be realistic or sharp.
        A huge round boulder would work just as fine >o<. At least I learned a lot about how to draw! I'm probably going to replace this 
        rock art with something else either way, because it's way too detailed when you shrink it and put it into the game.
      </p>

      <h2><a id="Node" href="#Node">Node to Joy</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Other than placing locations onto the map, I also rewrote most of my code. Now, I'm focusing more
        on Godot's Node system, the equivalent of Unity's Components. Basically, I made each feature for objects and enemies and NPCs into a 
        standalone node. Custom Nodes I made today include Kickable, Selectable, Teleportable, and Followable.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Kickable is for the physics objects, so that they move when you kick them,
        and can bump and propel other Kickable objects. By adding options such as affect_other_kickables and handle_collisions_externally, I made it support 
        enemies like the Toes and Shells too. Now, when I need to add a new physics object, all I need to do is drag and drop the Kickable node, and set up 
        some variables and options, without writing any code!
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Selectable is very versatile too. My old cursor selection system required me to add a new Array[] for each new 
        selectable node type, which took a lot of time, and contained lots of redundant code. Now, similarly, all I need to do is drag & drop, and choose the 
        highlight color. I can also connect a signal so that I can handle what happens when a click is received by the Selectable, such as picking up rocks, or 
        challenging a Fuzzk to a dance battle.
      </p>

      <img class="small-y" src="/images/Ring_of_Fuzzks.png"/>
      <p>Strange Fuzzk Ritual Sighted!</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Followable is what made the above ring of Fuzzks possible. Any node can easily follow a Followable by adding itself to 
        the Followable's followers Array, and then calling get_follow_position() every frame. Here, the Fuzzks are not following the player, but rather a floating circle 
        that follows the player. The circle has an instantaneous velocity equal to the displacement between it and the player. So basically, the Fuzzks look as if they are 
        smoothly following the player, rather than snapping to a circular orbit around the player.

      <h2><a id="TV" href="#TV">TV Minimization</a></h2>

      <img class="medium-y" src="/images/TV.png"/>
      <p>Yes, I know, it's actually a personal computer.</p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> No, the title is not inaccurate. This section is indeed about denoising (kinda).
        When I added the TV, somehow the audio was playing no matter how far from the player it was, and that's bad. It's noisy 
        and annoying because you can't turn the TV off. So I had to use some simple maths to model the diminution of audio strength
        as distance increases. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Problem: When distance is zero, volume is at maximum, 1dB. Sounds familiar? That's the exponential function! 
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
          <msup><mi>e</mi><mi>x</mi></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn> 
        </math>
        when
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
          <mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.</mn>
        </math>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> It should decrease as distance increases, so reflect it along the y-axis:
        <br>
        <br>
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
          <mi>f(x)</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>-x</mi>
        </math>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> And finally, I want the volume to go beneath zero, since in Godot -80dB is the minimum, where the 
        video source will be completely silent, I dilate it vertically and then translate it downwards. Also, I adjust the horizontal scale to account for 
        the in-game pixel distance units, setting the function to the following:
        <br>
        <br>
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
          <mi>f(x)</mi><mo>=</mo>
          <mn>81</mn><mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>-0.0004x</mi></msup>
          <mo>-</mo><mn>80</mn>
        </math>
      </p>
      <img class="medium-y" src="/images/tv_minimization.png"/>
      <p>Math classes are very useful.</p>
