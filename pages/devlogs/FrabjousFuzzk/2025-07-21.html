      <h2><a id="Boss" href="#Boss">Bossfight Alpha Version</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> As promised, here is the boss battle! (It's rough, but at least it works!)
      </p>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Rocks drop from the ceiling because the Scary Monster has a very loud roar (roar not implemented). 
        Throw rocks at the Scary Monster to damage it. Attack it enough to stun it. If you are too slow, it will start attacking you. When it attacks, 
        you have to dodge, which is the dance system. However, now, you only have one chance, so if you hit the wrong button, you are locked in that move, and 
        are guaranteed to take around 25% max stamina damage. If you stun it, however, you have three chances to hunt it, and if you succeed once, then your stamina
         will replenish by 50% max stamina. After each time you stun it and it wakes up, it eats one of your fuzzks to replenish its power. Then, the cycle starts again. 
         <br><br>
         <span class="tabspace"></span> Again throw rocks, again dance, again hunt, until <i>you</i> are eaten. But this was your plan all along. Because now all 7 Fuzzks (including Red) are inside the Scary Monster, you combine 
         into white light and destroy the scary monster. (The concept is that the scary monster is a creature made of darkness, but I didn't draw art for it yet).
         <br><br>
         <span class="tabspace"></span>If you lose, you have to reload a save you made in the overworld, so you should save (sleep) before you enter the cave. 
         If you win, there will be a short comic strip or cutscene that shows how you won against Scary Monster, and then you can reload the save from outside. 
         I'll be sure to implement an autosave before you enter the cave if I have time.

      <h2><a id="XP" href="#XP">Audio-visual representation of player XP and LVL</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Although the game itself is fun, players do not have an idea of why they should be hunting the 
        animals. That's because they don't understand that hunting shells and attacking toes levels them up, which makes it easier to win 
        dance battles against fuzzks. That's why I added XP points to show the player when exactly are they being rewarded. This is shown to work 
        in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, with the little green orbs that drop when the player kills mobs. It's used as a representation of a quantitative reward for interacting 
        with the combat system, and many other systems, in that game.

      </div>

      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        <span class="tabspace"></span> At first, I thought that blood splatter may fit the unpredictable violent style I wanted for the game, but it was too 
        disturbing to look at, especially because the art style meant kids would be more drawn to this game. I no longer wanted the violence to be shocking. Instead, 
        I want to show how violence is a natural part of the world, so that's why I decided against the idea that Fuzzks fed on blood like vampires, and made these 
        dream-like XP orbs, since the rest of the game was already dream-like.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The reason why the XP Shards in Frabjous Fuzzk are like this, and not blood, or like those orbs in Minecraft is due to the overall atmosphere 
        of my game. They are the sun, the moon, and stars, represented by spheres, crescents, and 4-pointed stars. In my opinion, the astronomy-related
         symbolism allows for my game to feel mystical, like a fairy tale from another planet. In comparison to Minecraft, where it's more grounded, my 
        game is more childish and playful, so our designs are different. In Frabjous Fuzzk, you kill enemies because you want to get better at dancing, 
        so you can recruit your brothers, and save Red Fuzzk. In Minecraft, you are fighting to survive. That's the difference.
