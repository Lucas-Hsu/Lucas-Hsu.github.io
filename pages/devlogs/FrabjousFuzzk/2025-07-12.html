        <h2><a id="Theme" href="#Theme">Game Theme</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I'm going to design the game from a top down approach. This will allow me to
          constantly keep track of my goals and the direction I want to design my game towards. All the features
          I add into the game should adhere to the core experience I want the game to provide.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Last night I had a dream about a blob creature with a smiley face
          bobbing up and down like it's dancing, but suddenly attacking a bird flying nearby. It might be a
          coincidence, but that's exactly what I want for my game, as it fits into the difficulty and fun design 
          I set down a few days ago. 
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> The core experience of the game will be:
          <br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> <i><b>"You are a playful blob creature that enjoys living with your brothers
          on the grass plain. But occasionally, when you are hungry, you take the role of a violent and ruthless predator,
          hunting down your prey."</i></b>
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> The new gameplay loop flowchart is shown in the diagram below. The high-intensity gameplay loop
          still obeys the Challenge kind of fun, but the low-intensity loop does not entirely fit into the Submission kind of fun.
          In a way, I mixed Fellowship into the game. And this is actually very good, as the reason why I wanted to include a mix of 
          difficult and easy gameplay was to make sure players don't give up too soon. Socializing with NPCs within the game would be a
          good way of keeping the player engaged even if they failed to capture prey that day. 
        </p>
        <img class="medium-y" src="/images/GameplayLoop-Themed.png"/>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Precise, timed controls and computation challenges will be neccessary to
          successfully hunt and kill a prey. For example, maintaining a safe distance away from prey to prevent from 
          alerting them, throwing rocks along a correct trajectory to stun the prey, and closing in for a kill. 
          Thinking about it right now, I think it will add another layer of difficulty if the prey has a hard shell 
          that requires the player to find weakpoints and inject toxins into the prey to kill it before it runs away.
          On the other hand, navigational skills are neccessary for locating the brother blobs and returning home to 
          sleep for the night.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="Name" href="#Name">Game Name</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Now that we have the core experience of the game set down, I can come up with a 
          name that encompasses that idea, so that players will be able to see what the game is about right from the name.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> If you didn't notice already, this devlog's background music is from an Alice through the Looking
          Glass film. I like how Lewis Caroll creates imaginary words by combining two different adjectives. The Jabberwocky poem 
          especially creates a playful and childish tone while also depicting violence, which fits my game perfectly.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> The player character is fluffy, fuzzy, cute, but also spiky, quick, and dangerous. Maybe, a kitten and a spider.  
          For me, 'K' is a very sharp letter, so I just put that onto a word like fuzzy, and I get: <b>"Fuzzk"</b>. I think it's pretty good, because
          when you read it, you expect it to say fuzzy, like you would expect the player character to be fuzzy and cute like usual, but it is unexpectedly 
          sharp and dangerous.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin: -0.2em;">Frabjous Fuzzk</h3>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I think that sounds very nice and is pretty unique. Better than just naming it "PlayHunt Game" like 
          I would if I used my old game naming convention. >v<
          <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2><a id="Tools" href="#Tools">Game Tools</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> <b>Game Engine: </b> I'm going to use the Godot Engine for this game. I've used Godot before, and felt 
          that it was fun to use, compared to Unity which felt very serious. Not only that, there are several features that Godot provides better than Unity,
          such as the intuitive node and scene based system, or making 2D-only games instead of 2D as an overlay on a 3D world. More importantly 
          GDScript is an interpreted language with optional static typing, which would make it quick and easy for me to code and debug the game.
          Godot has an integrated code editor, so I will be using that.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> <b>Art Program: </b> I'm not skilled at drawing, so I'm just going to choose an app that makes it easy 
            to create animations for the game. Pencil2D is free and has all the features I need for drawing simple art and animations with no shading.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> <b>DAW: </b> I'm going to use Logic Pro because I've always used it, and it has lots of features. Music is the 
          lowest priority though. I'm probably just going to add some ambient sound effects.
        </p>
      
        <h2><a id="Art" href="#Art">Game Art</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Drawing art is always exciting! I'm going to make it look cute because everything I draw inevitably looks funny.
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; place-items: center;">
            <img class="medium-y" src="/images/fuzzk-green-neutral.png"/>

          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; place-items: center;">

        </div>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Probably some simple one or two frame animations for actions will be enough. I think the other Fuzzks can be the other 6 colors of the rainbow. 
          As for the game as a whole, in order to not have to consider perspective distortions when drawing, I want the perspective to look like Undergrowth (or SprayGame!), where the y and z 
          axis are on the same axis, and have the same proportions:
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; place-items: center">
            <img class="small-y" src="/images/undergrowth_farm.jpeg"/>
            <p>Undergrowth</p>

            <p>SprayGame</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I think the low quality of my art will be a drawback for people seeking to enjoy the game,
          so I might ask a real artist to redraw all the art if my game is popular. However, my focus right now is coding the game
          and making it a reality.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> The same goes for music. I'm not good at that, so the game might sound boring. It all depends on if 
          I have time to do it. At the very least, having some sound effects from the environment would make the game feel calm and natural.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a id="List" href="#List">Success Criteria</a></h2>
        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> I used to just add features whenever I wanted as I programmed the game, but that made development 
          time drag on way past the day I thought it would be done, since I always wanted to add new things. The list I'm making will be
          how I make sure I have compeleted everything I wanted to do and am ready to release a version 1 of the game. I can make 
          improvements and additions after I release it based on feedback, of course.
          <br><br>
          <span class="tabspace"></span> To motivate the player and give the gameplay a sense of urgency, I will add a revenge story. Some 
          scary monster ate the Red Fuzzk, your best friend, so now you have to call the other Fuzzks to fight back and recover Red Fuzzk
          from scary monster's stomach. You have to eat lots of Shells to level up so that you are strong enough to beat the monster.

        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> All of the features I included above fit into either the categor of fun experience of living as a cute creature,
          or the category of hunting animals with precise controls and complex steps. However, I <i>am</i> suprised at how much stuff I have to implement.
          Therefore, my development plan will have to prioritize the most important things first.

        <p class="proportionalFont"> 
          <span class="tabspace"></span> Everything is going to be minimalistic to save time. No animations. No sound effects.
          Those will all be added once the core game is completed. If the game loop itself is not fun, then adding
          polish will only hide its flaws. Once I release the game, I can slowly add QOL features.
