      <h2><a id="Background" href="#Background">Background</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        In our school's game development club, we're currently in the design phase.
        This means, we needed a plot for the game to build on. The concept was a combination of multiple different worlds/levels,
        in different styles or themes, like Medieval or Cyberpunk, and the idea of having a different mini-game type gameplay in each level.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> The initial story was fine, but I felt like it lacks some things I expect in a good story that can hook the interest of the player. I can't quite
        place a finger on what exactly, so I'm writing this article to explore the components necessary to make a good game plot. I'm a novice at writing. None of my games really 
        had a story before, except Parody:1999, but for that game I just sort of copied the story over and added lots of jokes into it. So, expect errors or misconceptions 
        in this article. However, I am still confident that it would include at least a little bit of important observations or insights. 
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>

      <h2><a id="Theme" href="#Theme">Theme</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        The most important part of a story is the theme, the main idea, or the message that needs to be 
        communicated by the story. Without a theme, the story would not have a purpose. It's the motivation of the author: 
        <br><span class="tabspace"></span><i>"What do you want to achieve by telling this story?"</i><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> If nothing else, this helps you narrow down the scope of your story, so you are not stuck thinking about lots of different things at once,
        and so that you can quickly decide what to write about. For example, the main idea of this article is "Writing needs to contain motivations", 
        and so I focus on various motivations for components related to a story. "Motivations" is vague by itself, but it is enough to give me a 
        direction to write in without limiting myself too much.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Example game theme: <i>Emotions define a human.</i>
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> For the rest of this article, I will continue using this example taken from the first-round plot design of the game I'm producing 
        in our game development club. I don't think it'll be our final story, as there are a bunch of details that are contradicting or incomplete, but it serves as a good 
        and recent example.
      </p>



      <h2><a id="Backstory" href="#Backstory">Backstory</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        This is the motivation of the God of the world and NPCs. The world exists without the player. Things happen before the player begins the game. 
        Try to give these events a logical reason. If not logical, then at least symbolic of something, or connect it back to the themes.
        We want a solid backstory because if the world seems randomly put together, 
        it's much harder to suspend your disbelief and invest your time and concentrate on the game.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Example game plot (random backstory): <i>The King of the world has a full heart, and everyone else only has 1/10 of a heart. The 1/10 heart means they don't feel anything, and just 
        do whatever the King tells the to, but still there is a chance for them to develop feelings. All of the King's power comes from his powerful heart and emotions, chiefly selfishness used to manipulate others. There are also two other worlds,
        in which there also exists each a King, but the King there is actually the main character, not the King. The main character in the original world suddenly awakens a feeling of emptiness 
        one day, and decides to fight back, so the main character travels to the other worlds, kills themselves, steals their hearts, and returns to fight the King. </i>
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Example game plot (more logical): <i>The King is the only one in the world that has a heart. Everyone else is emotionless, acting as robotic workers for the selfish King. The King is extremely powerful due to his powerful heart full of emotions.
        However, this means King also feels the emotion of loneliness, so he injects the emotion of Empathy into the main character, in order to obtain companionship. The main character's 
        heart grows larger as the main character listens to more of the King's troubled emotions. This leads the the main character feeling empathetic towards the emotionless workers who are being 
        mistreated by the selfish and manipulative King. In response, the main character flees from the King. In other sections of the world, the main character gains more emotions that increase 
        the main character's power, and eventually returns to fight the King.</i>
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> A good backstory should be simple, not convoluted, and the resulting events that happen from the initial setup of the world should be 
        logically connected based on known information, so that it would not confuse the player. It's useful to have a backstory that explains your gameplay elements, which can further tie into the 
        character motivations.
      </p>



      <h2><a id="MainCharacter" href="#MainCharacter">Main Character</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        This is the motivation for both protagonist and player. The protagonist's motivations to participate in the journey/adventure must be clear based off of the 
        backstory, so that players can find it believable. The protagonist's actions along the journey should tie back to either their original motivations or the theme of the game.
        This way, you are able to tell an impactful story through allowing the player to be involved just as the protagonist is. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> Having a vague protagonist motivation would make the player feel lost, especially if your game is difficult. In this regard I found Silksong to be more 
        engaging than the original Hollow Knight because I remember being confused why I had to jump into the well into Hallownest, and why I was going to different areas like Greenpath, despite 
        NPCs telling me there is more stuff down there. In contrast, Hornet was being sent as a captive towards the capital when she escaped, yet she still wonders why she was captured. This allows both
        the protagonist and the player to feel curious and want to find out the reason behind it all, providing a clear motivation of exploration as well as exploration direction.
        <br><br>
        For the example game plot, the motivation could be: <i> One day, main character saves a worker from the King who was bullying him, and in response, the King grew mad and threatened 
        to remove the main character's heart fragment. Gaining the emotion of fear, the main character flees from the King. The main character explores the world to gain more emotions 
        in the hopes of getting more powerful so that you can protect yourself from the King and not be turned back into a normal emotionless worker. </i> 
        <br><br>
        <span class="tabspace"></span> There are two layers of motivations for the player here. First layer is the gameplay incentive layer, which is that playing the gain promises 
        unlocking more powers that would be more powerful and exciting to play around with. The second layer, the psychological layer, involves the player's disdain towards the King, 
        whom players observe to be selfish and abusive, giving the player motivation to fight back against the King. Also in the psychological layer, the player feels a desire to protect
        the main character from being turned back into an emotionless worker as they see how undesireable that situation is. An intro that combines all three of those motivations and presents 
        them to the player in a concise and easy-to-understand way would be the perfect start to a fun game.
      </p>



      <h2><a id="Conclusion" href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
      <p class="proportionalFont"> 
        Motivations are the most important part of a story, because it gives players a reason to believe the game world's existence and a reason to play the game instead of doing something else.
        I think the one thing that should be learned from this is that you have to design each component of the story with consideration of what you want to talk about in your story, and how to make 
        the player easily understand and accept the story. Of course, the basic motivations are not the only things needed in a game plot. Next, we can focus on the details of the in-game events, characters & dialogue, or even 
        consider letting the player decide the ending instead of having a cannon ending.
