<p>This is my first blog post. I will be writing about how I created this environment in which you read my blogs. I hope you find it interesting!</p>
<h3 id="blog-posts-page">Blog Posts Page</h3>
<p>The <a href="/articles/blogs/">BLOG POSTS</a> page provides access to all the blogs I wrote. When designing and coding, I had many ideas, but now only the best ones remain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried to make the list items expand upon mouse-hover to show blog details. It was reactive but difficult to use because items moved around as the cursor moves. For example, if you tried to select the item immediately below the one you are currently hovering over, by the time you reached its current position, the original hovered item would have contracted, moving your target, causing you to miss. It’s quite frustrating. So now I’m just cross-fading the content. Simple and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used a piano metaphor to guide the design as lists were too common to the point of being annoying to me. However, making my blog list horizontal, in rows of vertical items with vertical text, was a bad idea. It looked nice, but vertical text is hard to read, and there is not much space vertically to expand on. I rotated it a half pi radians counter-clockwise and ended up with a  list again ¯\/(ツ)\/¯ .</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img src="/articles/blogs/2026-01-23/all-blogs-page-day-of-month-styling-large.jpeg" alt="Day of Month Styling" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto"><figcaption class="img-caption">Day of Month Styling</figcaption></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>The day of month design was an accidental success. When I wrote 10rem instead of 10px, I discovered that the large text slightly clipping through the item tile looked nice. I intentionally made it clip even more and added the skew as I do to most elements on this site. Since the important information needed at a glance is the blog title, not the day it was published, it made sense to reduce the color contrast between the huge number and the tile background.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="this-page">This Page</h3>
<p>Did you know that clicking the title of this blog post redirects you to the <a href="/articles/blogs/">BLOG POSTS</a> page? I can choose what page it links to, so maybe one of the titles of future blogs would link to a secret page! Heheh.</p>
<p>That’s all for the most interesting choices I’ve made. There’s still a lot more I haven’t written about, but you’ll have to host your own blog if you ever want to find out more!</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Lucas Hsu</p> </article> </div>   </main> </body></html>
