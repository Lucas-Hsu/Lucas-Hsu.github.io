<p>In this blog post, I will talk about my experience playing <em>The Longest Journey</em>. Apart from sharing this game, I’m also writing this to help myself remember <em>The Longest Journey</em> more vividly, as I greatly enjoyed playing it. Note: this is <strong>not</strong> intended as a review and I will <strong>not</strong> be intentionally avoiding spoilers.</p>

<p>My journey began while I was browsing old games on the GOG storefront. In the <em>“You may like these products”</em> section, I saw a mysterious and melancholy cover image for a game with a strangely familiar title: <em>The Longest Journey</em>. In hindsight, that title was far from accurate, as <em>The Longest Journey</em> only lasted less than a third of my <em>Persona 5</em> playtime.</p>
<p>I cannot remember the last time I completed an adventure game, let alone one from the ’90s. From what I often hear, they’re notorious for their absurd puzzles that only a crazy person would find the answer to. Or, someone with the hint book. Although I enjoyed playing <em>Monkey Island</em> or <em>Grim Fandango</em> when I was younger, I never got far before getting stuck and abandoning them for other more exciting video games. <em>The Longest Journey</em> is different.</p>
<p>The 5-star user reviews call this game “The Best Adventure Game of All Time”. I don’t have enough information to assess its accuracy, but after completing the game last week, I can confidently say <em>The Longest Journey</em> is my favorite adventure game. In this game, there is a conflict between the world of science and the world of magic (Stark and Arcadia). In this game, there is a witty protagonist (April Ryan). In this game, you are the chosen one (Shifter/Guardian). In this game, there is a talking bird (Crow). I know, I know. Not exactly innovative. However, despite the clichés and tropes, absurd puzzles, and technical limitations, I greatly enjoyed <em>The Longest Journey</em>. The game weaves everything together into a compelling and well-told story, and the humor is consistently funny.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-tree-suffer.CeMKZJIy_Z1qpCIF.webp" alt="A tree spirit wakes up and speaks to April Ryan in her dream trip to Arcadia.

This is the only tree you can talk to in the game.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In the prologue, the protagonist April Ryan finds herself in a magical realm, in which she meets a talking tree and the White Dragon. The old tree spirit speaks in a powerful, ancient tone. It has likely lived a long life here overlooking the stone spires. And then we found out this tree is only an infant compared to The Mother of What Is.</p>
<p>The White Dragon has an old grandmother’s calm, soothing voice, layered with a sort of deep electric buzz. To me, it sounds like the White Dragon is in a totally different dimension despite being right in front of us, and that its powerful voice travels a long way to reach us, hence the distortion. At this point I knew I wanted to play the entire game, even if I had to look up a guide. (And that’s what I did.)</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-park-train.BpP3TxL__Z1pXjQ4.webp" alt="April Ryan is in the park on her way to the Venice Academy of the Visual Arts. A freight train passes over the metallic bridge." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="584"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan is in the park on her way to the Venice Academy of the Visual Arts.

<p>The worlds are beautifully rendered. The first time I walked through 23rd-century Venice, it felt huge! Walking back and forth between locations later becomes tedious, but the graphics always look great despite the low resolution. (I tried using the HD mod for a while but couldn’t ignore the distracting upscaling artifacts.) I think these fixed camera perspective games allow the game developers to design what the player sees the way a film director would. Not having a player character constantly stuck in the center of the screen makes for nicely-framed screenshots, at least.</p>
<p>I feel like Stark is under-explored. April Ryan arrives in the big city after escaping her tenuous relationship with her parents in the countryside, meeting new people and fulfilling her dream of becoming an artist. Then, suddenly it all gets torn away from her, and she has to go on a mission to save the world, no, worlds. We don’t even meet April’s friends again at the end of the story. Spending more time working at the café or hanging out with friends would stall the storyline in exchange for stronger bonds between April (the player) and April’s friends, which could make the spirit Charlie scene in the Banda Sprit Dig more effective. I don’t know which would be better.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-movie-theatre.B6YLw5w7_nU16k.webp" alt="April Ryan meets Cortez at the Mercury Theatre. Cortez asks what made her go out of her way to find him." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan meets Cortez at the Mercury Theatre. Cortez asks what made her go out of her way to find him.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>There is a simple moment in Chapter 2 that seems almost dreamlike. We arrive at the Mercury Theatre to find Cortez just sitting in the audience, watching an old film. There is a sense of urgency in our protagonist as she struggles to make sense of the strange things that are happening to her while stressing about the deadline of her art exhibit.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes ago, I had to look up a guide on how to enter the theatre. Turns out, you have to throw a piece of bread outside your window so that the seagull would try and peck the crumbs, freeing a floating rubber ducky that was stuck under some boards. Then, you have to solve a variation of the pipe puzzle to obtain a pair of clamps and combine it and the ducky with a string to get a claw like in those claw machines. Next, inflate the balloon to open the clamps, drop it down around the key stuck on the subway tracks, then wait for the ducky to deflate so that the clamps close on the keys, allowing you to fish it out.</p>
<p>I think this scene is great. The player’s frustration is the same as April Ryan’s. Both of us had to overcome numerous hurdles to come talk to this person who we still see as a crazy dude. We wonder what was the point of all this. And the next moment, the game acknowledges it, and tells us that yeah, that’s the point! What made April go out of her way to find Cortez here? What made me go out of my way to read a guide to find Cortez here? April could have just given up and spent her weekend with her good friends, and I could have just abandoned this game and played another game that I enjoy more. But we didn’t! It must be destiny!</p>
<p>At the same time, in our conversation with Cortez, we hear a surreal dialogue play between an anxious man and a gruff-sounding man. I was confused by what they were talking about. It didn’t make sense to me. I tried to transcribe their lines, shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[My transcription of the classic film playing in the Mercury Theatre]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> Who is it? <em>(A long pause)</em> I knew you would come, sooner or later. <em>(Sighs)</em> There’s no way out of here. Did you know that? There’s no way out of Victory Hotel. All exits just…they just lead back inside.</p>
<p><strong>Gruff Man:</strong> There is a way out…just not for you.</p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> It’s getting closer. They will be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>Gruff Man:</strong> Soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> Bastard! Why are you so—? Do you have any reason to be happy?</p>
<p><strong>Gruff Man:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> Then why be happy?</p>
<p><strong>Gruff Man:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> Because we’re both going to die!</p>
<p><strong>Gruff Man:</strong> Everyone dies.</p>
<p><strong>Anxious Man:</strong> Doesn’t have to be this way. We can…we can walk out of here. Go our different ways. Forget about Victory Hotel and…and… <em>(Pause)</em> Did you know? When I came here, I had nothing to live for.  Now, now I don’t want to die. I want to live. But not, not in here, not like this.</p>
<p><strong>[Audio loops back to the beginning.]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sense of urgency in the anxious man’s words mirrors April’s stress that I previously mentioned. Interestingly, the film also extends to the whole of Stark, as the anxious man could be referencing the looming destruction of the Balance and merging of Stark and Arcadia when he says “It’s getting closer. They will be here soon.” Still, it’s a bit confusing why the gruff-sounding man says the exit is “not for you” to the anxious man if we are to interpret April as the anxious man and Cortez as the gruff-sounding man, as April’s the only person that can Shift.</p>
<p>I knew I had a general idea of what was happening here, but I was unsure if my transcription is entirely correct. So, I checked online and found that someone already transcribed the film and uploaded it to the TLJ Wiki. Still, I’m keeping my own version fully intact because it’s <em>my</em> interpretation.</p>
<p></p><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-alley-tlj.C5zgrgWP_6qTih.webp" alt="Hey, it's the title of the game!" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">Hey, it's the title of the game!</figcaption></figure>
Cortez takes us out of the theatre into the back alley, freeing us from the confusion. Outside, he reveals the true nature of the world, or rather, worlds, to April, clearing away her confusion about the strange events happening recently. Unexpectedly, this reminded me of Corvo’s first encounter with the Ousider in <em>Dishonored</em>. Both protagonists are formally introduced to the magical side of the world that they were previously oblivious of.<p></p>
<p>This is also when Cortez directly references <em>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</em>, saying “Why, Alice, I’m sending you through the looking-glass!” I usually only see references to the first book, such as the mad tea party or the White Rabbit, so this was refreshing to me. (Also, the Chapter 2 subtitle is simply “Through the Looking Glass.”)</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-shift-april.Bf7e50Vu_ZJ2m3I.webp" alt="April Ryan travels through the Shift." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="584"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan travels through the Shift.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>April enters the Shift to Arcadia, as she is a Shifter, one of the few who are able to travel between the two worlds. This is the third or fourth time I’ve seen the cutscene version of April’s 3D model. I think it looks awful. Like with the first image in this blog post, it was funny the first few times I saw it, but it begins to interfere with the story. I’m sorry, I can’t stop laughing at your very serious cutscenes! The environments are beautiful, but April just looks like…a zombie (-_-) . At least the developers were aware of this limitation too and decided to use a hand-drawn version of April on the game’s cover art.</p>
<p>In Arcadia, April learns how to speak Na’ven, the common language of all creatures in Arcadia, from Vestrum Tobias. Tobias also tells her of the Divide, which led to the separation of Stark and Arcadia from the one Earth, and the Vanguard, who plan to reunite the worlds at the risk of unleashing chaos. That’s all nice, but April wants to go home now. Cortez told her to find Brian Westhouse if she wanted to return to Stark.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-brian-westhouse.YmKN-HDJ_e8BE2.webp" alt="April Ryan visits Brian Westhouse in his cliffside abode. He's a rare human from Stark in this world of magical creatures, though born three hundred years earlier." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan visits Brian Westhouse in his cliffside abode. He's a rare human from Stark in this world of magical creatures, though born three hundred years earlier.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>After running a few errands for the map merchant, April finds out about the location of Mr. Westhouse’s house. Brian Westhouse’s past is a mystery in this game. Brian is not a Shifter, yet he was able to travel from Stark to Arcadia through some kind of ritual. The fact that his journey to Arcadia trapped him in limbo for three hundred years contrasts with how easy it is for April to Shift between worlds. She can do it in her sleep!</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-venar-ambassador.CkH4_2YK_N20sx.webp" alt="April Ryan visits the home of Abnaxus the Venar, ambassador of the creatures who experience time nonlinearly. " loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan visits the home of Abnaxus the Venar, ambassador of the creatures who experience time nonlinearly. </figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Later on in the story, April is forced to return to Arcadia. There, she meets Abnaxus, who speaks in broken grammar not because he’s bad at English—I meant Alltongue—but because he experiences time in a fundamentally different way. To the Venar, everything in their life happens at the same time. But of course, the writers need to find a way to prevent these creatures from being overpowered, so the Venar cannot predict the future. They know of possible futures, but never exactly which one will happen. It also conveniently avoids questions of free will that might arise from a future that has already happened.</p>
<p>What pleasantly surprised me is that the writers didn’t stop there. They give us more reasons when one would have sufficed! The second reason is ethical. The Venar think it’s morally wrong to tell others about their future, because they see it as their responsibility not to disturb the Balance which governs all things. And that would be enough to satisfy me too, but there’s more. The Venar have noticed a Veil which shrouds their future in darkness. Beyond a certain point, they can no longer see the events that transpire as they do the other moments in their life. This is a great addition to the world-building, because it expresses the weight of the events happening to both Stark and Arcadia. The Venar, who once lived above the flow of time, have been robbed of their supernatural abilities. It shows that something is messing with the fundamental components of the worlds.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-venar-trust.BPicHgN2_ZPjlIS.webp" alt="Abnaxus talking about the concept of trust." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="126"><figcaption class="img-caption">Abnaxus talking about the concept of trust.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Another thing Abnaxus mentions is the concept of trust. Why, of course they don’t need to think about trust at all, because they experience the past and the future at the same moment. The Venar always know what happened, is happening, and will happen, but “amongst those who flow with time, trust is important, a fragile thing.” I think it’s interesting to explore the perspectives of creatures who don’t experience reality the same way we do. We’d all behave very differently if we could completely trust another individual.</p>
<p>However, I think the Venar should place even more importance on trust than we do, precisely because they know so much. Since the Venar already know everything they will know at every point in time, they also know that there are some things that they will never know. The Venar have to accept the fact that they will never ever know the truth and still place their trust in that person, while I can cling onto the hope that a future will arrive in which I can verify if they told me the truth. To us, trust means believing the truth of something when you don’t know the truth. (Notice that I chose to use “when”, which denotes a specific point in time.) Without the time-dependency, a Venar’s trust is something more profound than our fragile trust.</p>
<p>I think for us humans, the existence of a future gives us a sense of freedom, and the unknown unknowns drive us to explore. In a way, it feels like being a Venar makes you a prisoner of your own life; too familiar with life’s boundaries. It’s almost suffocating to think about. But I’m only human. I’m sure a spider would feel paranoid if it imagined itself with only two eyes, too.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-market-crow.BY8G9liA_ZT4Fnh.webp" alt="April Ryan rescues a bird from the cups-game merchant's cage. Bird explains the origin of its name. April decides to call it &#34;Crow&#34; instead." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan rescues a bird from the cups-game merchant's cage. Bird explains the origin of its name. April decides to call it "Crow" instead.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As part of a chain of errands to get on a ship to Alais, April frees an old sailor’s pet bird Bird. April names it Crow, after her childhood favorite cartoon, Crowboy. I thought I’d quickly become irritated by Crow’s squawking, but I grew to like it quite a lot. So much that I can’t say “it” without it feeling unjust, so I’m just going to refer to Crow with “he” from now on.</p>
<p>Crow later escapes from the old sailor and joins April on her journey and plays a role in many of the game’s puzzles. It’s always hilarious when we get to use Crow. For example, he crashed into a window because I neglected to let April open the window first. And, another time, I kindly asked Crow to peck fossilized pigeon excrements, but he didn’t want to, so April had to sternly force him to do it. Now that I think about it, most of the puzzles in this game weren’t that bad, except for when it expects you to have picked up a random object somewhere and then use it on an object in another place to obtain some other item for you to use in this exact moment. In contrast, Crow is always available through the flute when he is needed. It feels awesome when you encounter an obstacle and wonder if Crow will help you, and you try the flute and discover that he actually does!</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-diary-gribbler.C1AVy8RU_1dE8sD.webp" alt="April Ryan's diary. In this entry, she humorously describes her encounter with the Gribbler." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan's diary. In this entry, she humorously describes her encounter with the Gribbler.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I didn’t mention it until now, but April constantly updates her diary as the game progresses. It’s like a journal, or a quests page, in most other games. It gives you a clearer understanding of what has happened in the game, and sometimes provides hints on how to progress. However, it also allows us to get to know April better, as the writers flesh out her personality and explores her views on the people she meets.</p>
<p>From the entry about the Gribbler, we see April as a kind and humorous woman who helps people in need and enjoys joking about her dire situations. It shows she’s self-aware and resilient, too. The swear words occasionally used in the diary helps make her seem more lively. It’s not exactly an overreaction, but it is funny in a dramatic way.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-banda-celebration.CIxDRTm5_ZyySEQ.webp" alt="April Ryan speaks humbly to the Banda Elder after saving the Little Ones from the Gribbler. " loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan speaks humbly to the Banda Elder after saving the Little Ones from the Gribbler. </figcaption></figure></div>
<p>After April defeats the Gribbler, the Little Ones hold a celebration in her honor. April is always so humble about the good things she does. It shows her manners and humility. She reserves respect for every strange new creatures she meets in her journey, and modifies her own speech habits to mirror whoever she’s talking to.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-crash-crow.BlPxYsnW_Z1BCR5d.webp" alt="April Ryan reunites with Crow after Captain Nebevay's ship sunk. Crow notes how the sidekicks in legends always survive." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan reunites with Crow after Captain Nebevay's ship sunk. Crow notes how the sidekicks in legends always survive.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And that’s why it was so shocking to see April’s selfish side. April convinces Horatio Nebevay to take her to the island of Alais, but on the way, a chaos storm approached. Of course, it was here to chase after April. Yet, despite putting everyone on board in danger, April chooses to tamper with the ship’s navigation to nullify the captain’s order to change course away from Alais. Here, April views her mission as more important than the lives of the ship’s crew. Although that is technically true, as the fate of the two worlds depends on her mission’s success, she still knowingly puts everyone’s lives at risk.</p>
<p>Then for some reason she takes an axe and tries to break open a chest, accidentally hacking a hole in the hull and sinking the entire ship. Now she’s stranded on floating debris with the knowledge that she probably killed everyone.  It drove the plot forward, sure, but it also reveals April’s character flaws. She’s not always perfect, not always clever and humorous and polite. Sometimes, she makes dumb mistakes too. Of course she’s prone to poor judgement and selfishness, and clumsiness, she’s human! It’s good writing. The axe-causing-ship-to-sink part was weird, though.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-underwater-city.CPUkdpX-_sMtSr.webp" alt="April Ryan finds a black pearl in the outskirts of a Maerum city." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="583"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan finds a black pearl in the outskirts of a Maerum city.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>April gets pulled into the sea, and she discovers that there’s a whole city under the water. I thought this would be like Rapture from <em>BioShock</em>, but was unfortunately disappointed. We literally only get to see one room! And, how can you expect me to believe that the Maerum queen’s bedroom is the same size as mine when there’s clearly a lot of large and fancy buildings in the background? Once again I am disappointed by technical limitations.</p>
<p>This is also where the “Rotate Crystals To Matching Symbols” puzzle takes place. I’ll never understand why game developers add these types of puzzles into their games. I only just played Arx Fatalis last month, and they had a very similar puzzle in the underground crypt. Except, this underwater cave puzzle doesn’t provide you with any extra information or hints, so I had to try-check-revise my way through the second part of the puzzle matching the drawings in the center of the altar with the symbols on the crystals. All it does is waste my time. What more can I say other than I hate these kinds of puzzles?</p>
<p>Luckily the game redeems itself soon after, as the Alatian section is one of my favorite parts of <em>The Longest Journey</em>.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-stickmen-woody.D2-3z5FZ_ZVivPQ.webp" alt="April Ryan listens to the Stickman Woody. It seems the Stickmen hold values radically different from humans." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan listens to the Stickman Woody. It seems the Stickmen hold values radically different from humans.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Arriving on the island to help form a peace treaty between the Maerum and the Alatians, April meets the Stickmen. They’re trying to build a crossbow to the moon, but someone’s snoring too loudly next to the telephone totem poles, so they can’t focus. This leads to a logical puzzle where you have to point the totems to form a chain so that you can get through to the sleeping man and wake him up. It’s basically a macro-version of the pipe puzzle, and you have to memorize symbols which represent the directions you can point the receiving and sending ends of the telephones. I like this puzzle, because it was logic-based and not cryptic. It could have been very annoying to run between the telephones double-checking everything, but luckily we have technology. I just screen-recorded everything :) .</p>
<p>Also here, I almost went crazy trying to find a rope to attach to the crossbow. I clearly remember picking up some ropes on the shore but it just wasn’t in my inventory anymore. I got frustrated running around the map, so I checked a guide. Oh man, how foolish I look! I used the rope to climb down the cave, but forgot to retrieve the rope once I climbed back up. I completely forgot. I think I just assumed I would never need it again, because it is an adventure game. I think if this were a 3D game, I’d have a more vivid impression of the rope as an actual object and not a puzzle piece. Anyway, it was funny.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-allatian-teller.DQYXobOh_Z1MzUWY.webp" alt="April Ryan listens as the Alatian Teller explains why the Tales must be told in an Alatian's own words." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan listens as the Alatian Teller explains why the Tales must be told in an Alatian's own words.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Finally, April arrives at the Alatian settlement in the volcano. Here, she speaks to a young girl, a woman, a man, and an old man, hearing from each of them a unique Tale. At the end of an Alatian’s telling of their Tale, they say something like “This is the Tale of the Stars, and I told it in my own words, just like my teacher did.” At first it struck me as just a strange formality. However, the Teller later explains that the Tales are always told in one’s own words, rather than repeated word-by-word, because it allows them to remember the stories better and understand how it is important to their own lives.</p>
<p>That’s the inspiration for this blog post, if you couldn’t tell by the subtitle. Everyone who has played <em>The Longest Journey</em> can write an objective review or critique of the game, but only I can tell this story in my own words. My perspective on this game is what makes this post unique, because everyone experiences the game differently. And, by retelling <em>The Longest Journey</em> in my own words, I can remember this Tale better, and understand how it is important to my own life.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-old-god.I2uHjZQs_Z12oGw8.webp" alt="The Old God, a Dragon, worshipped by the Maerum." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">The Old God, a Dragon, worshipped by the Maerum.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then April swims into a huge underwater pyramid and enters a cave and she stands there in front of a strangely familiar shape on the cave walls, when suddenly, THE WALL OPENS UP AND YOU LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE EYE OF A GIGANTIC ANCIENT GOD AND YOU REALIZE THAT THE ENTIRE PYRAMID YOU SAW BEFORE IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE DRAGON HALF-BURIED IN THE SEAFLOOR.</p>
<p>The sheer sense of scale in that moment felt powerful to me. We don’t get to see the entire body of the Old God until later, and even then the Dragon didn’t look as large because it had nothing to be compared with. Here, we see its eye the size of a human being. With such a huge eye, it could see so far, so much, yet it is stuck here, immobile under the sea. How many millions of years did it spend down here, slumbering? How many more? In comparison, I am…microscopic.</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon speaks slowly, like an earthquake tearing through the land, reverberating, reverberating… “Ask your questions…and be gone.” In this moment, April Ryan, the Chosen One and revered by all magical creatures, is suddenly insignificant and vulnerable, barely worth talking to. We realize that being the Chosen One doesn’t mean we’re the most important person in the worlds. We see things that are far out of our reach. Still, in this moment, we matter, if just a tiny bit. April is an important chess piece, it seems.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-lady-alvane.D5_yynei_2nrAyJ.webp" alt="April Ryan meets Lady Alvane, who tells April of her destiny." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan meets Lady Alvane, who tells April of her destiny.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then April Ryan returns to Stark, sees her best friend getting shot and killed by the Vanguard police and almost getting captured herself, and gets saved by a portal opened by Lady Alvane. To the player, this place is familiar, as Lady Alvane is the old lady who was telling this story from the first scene in the entire game. To April Ryan, she feels a strange sense of familiarity, as if she has somehow met Lady Alvane before. My intuition told me that Lady Alvane <em>is</em> April Ryan. Why else would they introduce an old lady telling the story of a young woman? I was wrong, though.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-arcadia-painting.DaytPz0b_Z2fJLn7.webp" alt="April Ryan's painting of Arcadia, which April uses to find the White Dragon from her dream in the prologue." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="582"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan's painting of Arcadia, which April uses to find the White Dragon from her dream in the prologue.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>After hearing Lady Alvane’s wise words, April begins to awaken her powers as a Shifter. By using her talent in painting, she opens a Shift that leads back to the cliff in the dream sequence at the beginning of the game. The White Dragon is dying. In the Mother’s place, a young White Dragon is born. The White Dragon lives on. From this point onwards, the game’s plot feels heavily compressed, probably the developers scrambling to tie up the loose ends before development budget runs out.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-jacob-macallen.R0apKcsC_1Swd0x.webp" alt="April Ryan gets caught snooping around in Jacob McAllen's office.

<p>April infiltrates the secretly evil corporation and enters the Jacob McAllen’s office to find their secrets. Unfortunately, she gets caught. McAllen goes on a classic villain speech, including the part where the villain acknowledges itself as the villain and “cleverly” points out this cliché. Yes it’s all been done before. I wonder why villains continue being evil even when they know villains always lose.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-rooftop-dragons.DoBi9glU_98y9s.webp" alt="Jacob McAllen confronts Cortez on the rooftops of the MTI building.

It is here that Cortez and McAllen's identities as Dragons are revealed.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then Cortez saves us from McAllen. We find out that they’re brothers, and moreover, they’re both Dragons. Red Dragon and Green Dragon. It makes perfect sense, and the game hints at it constantly, but I never saw it coming :0 . I mean, there’s a mural of a Dragon right next to where you first meet Cortez!</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-bad-play.DDvAu8GA_Z2vnT5b.webp" alt="Cortez says that McAllen's lines sound like they come from a bad play." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="127"><figcaption class="img-caption">Cortez says that McAllen's lines sound like they come from a bad play.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Then, also on the rooftop, Cortez ridicules McAllen’s clichés. That’s when the clichés transformed from a flaw to a clever trick by the writers, in my mind. McAllen is a Dragon! It’s laughable how much he has fallen in his hunger for power, mingling with the humans, picking up these uninspired, repetitive phrases. It makes McAllen seem more foolish than powerful. Once again, the writers turned a potential shortcoming into an effective creative choice. Yes, yes, I like this game very much!</p>
<p>April then does a bunch of things at the space colony mentioned all the time throughout the game and enters a rift in between the worlds. Who knew the space colony, which is constantly mentioned by characters in the game, would play a such a big role in the game? Almost everything in this game is significant in some way to the story.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-guardians-realm.BPmoW3n3_ZqaCke.webp" alt="April Ryan walks in the endless blue desert in the Guardian's Realm.

<p>The rift takes April Ryan to the Guardian’s Realm. It kinda reminds me of the Half-Life Xen realm, fortunately without any annoying aliens that seem to one-shot you or frustrating platforming challenges. Vestrum Tobias told April that she is the new Guardian, and so must take the previous Guardian’s place and spend one thousand years in the tower maintaining the Balance.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-face-father.ua7UaMbF_hYcia.webp" alt="As part of the Three Trials in the Guardian's Realm, April Ryan faces her greatest fear: her violent father." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">As part of the Three Trials in the Guardian's Realm, April Ryan faces her greatest fear: her violent father.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In the Guardian’s Realm, April Ryan confronts her greatest fear that is her violent father. However, in the game’s police station level, you could make April call her mother and tell her she misses her. In the same phone call, April also tells her mother that she’s sorry, and asks if her father is alright after she pushed him down the stairs. At that moment, April already faces her past, so I think it doesn’t make sense that her father is her greatest fear. I really don’t think this “I forgive you” was a big revelation. That’s why it also felt like the spirit Charlie’s advice in the Banda Spirit Dig didn’t really build up to anything. But, ehh, I can’t think of anything better.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-thousand-years.QzKdzBWl_1zReiQ.webp" alt="April Ryan ponders what it means to be Guardian for a thousand years." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">April Ryan ponders what it means to be Guardian for a thousand years.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In the Guardian’s Tower shown in the cutscene at the beginning of the game, April prepares herself to fulfill her role as the new Guardian. All the things she once knew would be gone after a thousand years. She’d be trapped like Brian Westhouse is, alone in an alien world, unable to return to her old life. It’s different from a long nap, because she won’t be dreaming. As the Guardian, she will think of nothing and feel of nothing, being only one with the Balance. And, it’s not entirely the same as death either, because she’ll still live a full life after this. She can’t make sense of all this, and she doesn’t want to do it. However, it is her duty, and she is ready to accept her duty unquestioningly.</p>
<p>And then we find out that April is not the new Guardian. That is Gordon Halloway’s destiny. So what will April do now? The entire journey, she was slowly accepting her role as the Chosen One. But now, she has to go home. Can she even go home? Pretend nothing strange ever happened? The White Dragon told April to be herself, but who is April Ryan? Is it the girl living in the countryside, the young artist studying at VAVA, or a Shifter that provides help people selflessly? Her duty made her leave her old identity, but now she has neither. It’s ironic how she didn’t need to spend a thousand years as Guardian to feel so lost.</p>
<div class="img-wrapper-block"><figure class="img-container"><img  src="/_astro/tlj-alvane-crow.DEFDubTh_1ao5mK.webp" alt="Lady Alvane telling another story to an elderly Crow." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1024" height="710"><figcaption class="img-caption">Lady Alvane telling another story to an elderly Crow.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Remember when I told you I was wrong to think that Lady Alvane is April Ryan? I wasn’t completely wrong. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Lady Alvane is not April Ryan, but rather, Lady Alvane <strong>was</strong> April Ryan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense, because after spending so much time living a completely different life, your old self begins to seem different and unfamiliar, and it begins to sound like someone else’s story. Embarking on the longest journey of your life shows you things that fundamentally change who you are! After all, you’re not the same person now as you were at the moment of your birth.</p>
<p>Like all good stories, <em>The Longest Journey</em> begins and ends at the same place, in more than one layer. This game has exceeded my expectations and is well worth the time. At the end of this longest journey, I see that it was all just the beginning of everything else.</p>
<p>May the Balance bless us all,</p>
