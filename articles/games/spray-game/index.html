<p>In this game, you are an elephant in a water balloon fight against monkeys!</p>
<p>I spent 40 hours in December 2023 to learn how to use Unity and make everything in this game. I also created a manual with a few tips to help new players learn how to play this difficult game.</p>
<p>I became quite skilled at <em>Spray Game</em> playing it during development, so I continued increasing its difficulty to match my skill level. It became too difficult for beginners, so I added a Baby Mode for beginner players to try out. In January 2026, I re-built the game make the difficulty setting a simple toggle button and updated the manual accordingly.</p> </article> </div>   </main> </body></html>
