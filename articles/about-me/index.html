<p>I am Lucas Hsu, The Grand Owner of All Things, at least on this website. Here you’ll find everything about me except the things I choose not to share. If you just want to know what I’m up to recently, visit <a href="/articles/now">NOW PAGE</a>.</p>
<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
<p>I was born on a beautiful, sunny island. My family relocated every few years until we finally settled in Shanghai, China. After a few years in this city, I entered the high school where I currently spend most of my time now studying and socializing.</p>
<p>I spend some of my spare time at home with my family, making conversations with my parents and tutoring my younger siblings. The rest is spent on what I enjoy the most: playing video games and programming. Did you know that I’ve been gaming ever since the young age of 2? There you go, my hobbies are not very unique. I noticed that too.</p>
<p>Still, I would never doubt that developing video games is a great hobby. More than just writing code, it’s an opportunity for me to draw things, compose music, and write stories, all working for one central goal. When I’m bored of just passing time, I can instead make use of time by creating something uniquely my own. I think it reminds me that I am part of the world, not just an observer of content.</p>
<p>Now I’d like to tell you a little about some of my <em>Favorites</em>.</p>
<h3 id="favorites">Favorites</h3>
<p>My favorite book is <em>Dracula</em> by Bram Stoker because it’s a fictional book I recently read outside of coursework that has a dark, enthralling atmosphere. You can tell I don’t read as much as I used to because the only other books I remember enjoying are the <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Magic Tree House</em>, and <em>Goosebumps</em> series. Maybe they should compile a book out of recent blog posts, diary entries, letters, and news articles to trick me into reading books again. Wait… that’s kinda like <em>Dracula</em>!</p>
<p>I don’t have favorite songs, which makes it awkward when strangers try to socialize by asking about my musical preferences. I listen to music a lot, of course, but it’s highly contextual. Sometimes, I listen to minimalistic pieces like <em>Gymnopedies</em>, while other times it’s the more chaotic albums by The Cranberries. When I play video games, I listen to only the game’s music, because I don’t want to disrupt the experience with outside music. Put simply, I enjoy music that complements the current moment. Next time you ask me what my favorite song is, I’m going to say it’s the sound of your voice ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ ~☆ . Anything else would be a distraction from our conversation.</p>
<p>My favorite film is <em>Toy Story 2</em> because it looks good and has many hilarious moments while exploring emotional themes. Also, films often make me feel frustrated as a powerless spectator, but this one doesn’t do that.</p>
<p>My favorite video game is <em>BioShock</em> because it uses the player’s involvement in the story, and interaction with the world and characters, to create a strong, personal impact on the player. There are many other games that do this, but this one is my first.</p>
<p>That’s all. If you are disappointed that we have nothing in common, hopefully you will find a satisfactory answer in this <a href="/articles/list-of-games-i-approve-of">LIST OF GAMES I APPROVE OF</a>.</p>
